        "# Report: Few-Shot Prompting for Berlin Locations\n",
        "\n",
        "## Objective\n",
        "The goal of this exercise was to explore how few-shot prompting affects GPT’s ability to provide structured information about Berlin, including clubs, restaurants, parks, and theaters. I wanted to see how example formatting influences consistency and accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## Method\n",
        "1. **Few-shot / instruction-only without following GPT model:**  \n",
        "   Initially, I gave GPT a system message describing that it should act as a historian familiar with Berlin. I asked questions about top clubs, restaurants, or parks without providing examples.  \n",
        "   - **Result:** The model seemed to give correct answers, but the formatting varied, sometimes using \"is\" instead of a colon (`:`) to separate fields.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Few-shot prompting following the GPT model:**  \n",
        "   I then provided one or two examples for clubs and restaurants in the following format:  \n",
        "   Item: Name\n",
        "   Area: Location\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Observation:** Model responses started matching the provided structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Adding a third example (museums):**  \n",
        "I extended the context to include museums as a third example, maintaining the same `Item` / `Area` pattern. Then I asked for top theaters.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## Findings / Observations\n",
        "- **Formatting consistency improves with examples:**  \n",
        "- Few-shot answers varied in punctuation and layout.  \n",
        "- Few-shot answers following the GPT model (system, assistant, user)followed the `Item: ... \\nArea: ...` pattern closely.\n",
        "- **Model sometimes repeats areas:**  \n",
        "- Example: All theaters returned “Area: Mitte” even if the actual location differs slightly — minor hallucination likely due to limited examples.\n",
        "- **Correct entities generally returned:**  \n",
        "- The model correctly listed known parks, and theaters, showing strong recall when examples were given.  \n",
        "- **More examples reduce errors:**  \n",
        "- Adding a third example (museums) helped the model generalize formatting to new categories, though content accuracy still depends on its knowledge cut-off.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Learnings\n",
        "1. **Few-shot examples are powerful:** Providing structured examples guides GPT to produce consistent and predictable output.  \n",
        "2. **Explicit formatting matters:** Repeating the desired output format in multiple examples reduces “creative” deviations.  \n",
        "3. **Hallucination is still possible:** GPT may repeat areas or invent minor details; careful review is needed for critical tasks.  \n",
        "4. **Roles enhance learning:** Using `system`, `user`, and `assistant` roles aligns with the model’s training and improves pattern adoption.  \n",
        "5. **Zero-shot vs few-shot:** Zero-shot can produce correct answers, but few-shot ensures structural consistency and reliability in formatting.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "## Conclusion\n",
        "Few-shot prompting is an effective method for eliciting structured and consistent responses from GPT. By providing multiple examples, the model learns the desired format in real-time during inference. However, while formatting consistency improves, minor factual hallucinations may still occur, so outputs should be verified for accuracy in real-world applications.\n",
